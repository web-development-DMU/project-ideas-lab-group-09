                <p>
                    Team Monkague has chosen to do <a href="../../people/P2795278.html">James's</a> idea of a 
                    <a href="../../proposals/CharactersInfo.html">Character Info</a> database for "StarWars the Clone Wars"
                    animated series. This may be potentally expanded to other cannon projects linked to this show (e.g. 
                    "The Bad Batch"). This will function similar to websites like IMDB, but focoused around the shows characters,
                    affiliations, episodes and factions. This also maybe expanded to add infomation about directors, show runners 
                    or voice actors

                <p>
                    So far the team has organised into working on this page and the <a href="../../proposals/CharactersInfo.html">proposal page</a>.
                    By the end of the third session we are aiming to have prototyped some ideas with the proposal page, finish this page for now 
                    and make a team folder for working on the project.
