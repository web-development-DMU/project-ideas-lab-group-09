![Catalogue page](/teams/SlimeBalls/SlimeBookCanvaDesign/2.png)
>>>>>>> origin/main

*This page will either contain a limited amount or all of the book in the DB. If the data set is too large we may need to add a load more button at the bottom.*

*Anyways the book covers are going to technically be links to their own page which will show the users the chapters and what chapter they are currently on. We may add a little star in the corner to show that you may favourite that book from this page. The users will be able to search for a specific book using the search bar.*

![Book page](/teams/SlimeBalls/SlimeBookCanvaDesign/3.png)

*This is our prototype look of a specific book page. Here it contains all of its information and all of the books chapters.*

*The user will then be able to bookmark a ca=hapter and it will update it to say "currently reading". The users will also be able to search for a specific chapter.*
