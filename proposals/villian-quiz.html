    <h1>Villain Personality Profiler</h1>

    <p><strong>Villain Personality Profiler</strong> (working title)</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An interactive personality-style quiz that determines what kind of villain a user is. 
        Users answer scenario-based questions, and the system generates a villain archetype 
        complete with traits, strengths, weaknesses, and a dramatic villain persona.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Villain Personality Profiler is designed as an interactive, story-driven quiz 
        that reveals what kind of villain a user would be. The experience blends humour, 
        personality style assessment, and dramatic flair. Users progress through a series 
        of scenario based questions that explore motivations, decision making tendencies, 
        and moral flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on the user's responses, the system assigns a villain archetype such as 
        <em>The Mastermind</em>, <em>The Chaos Bringer</em>, or <em>The Shadow Manipulator</em>. 
        Each archetype includes a detailed profile describing personality traits, strengths, 
        weaknesses, and a thematic villain backstory. The goal is to create an engaging, 
        playful experience that feels personalised and entertaining.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application may also include an administrator interface that allows team members 
        to manage quiz content. Administrators could add or edit questions, create new villain 
        archetypes, and review analytics such as which villain types are most commonly assigned. 
        This ensures the quiz can evolve over time and remain fresh for returning users.
