                    Proposed by: <a href="/people/P2867907.html">Thomas Hague</a>

                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea behind this comes from interval excersises, where you do a certain exersie for
                    a small amount of time, take a small break and go on to the next. Say you do 8 diffrent 
                    exersices for 50 seconds each with a 10 second break inbetween, you can then repeat this 
                    as many rounds as you want in the same session
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>
                    Description
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The application will allow the user to choose a time period for an exersise and the rest,
                    having it being the default for all the exersise to have the same time and then allowing
                    them to set diffrent indvidual times for each exersice in a round. You will be able to have
                    unlabled numbered excersises or choose an exersise from a drop down or make a custom label.
                    You would then set the number of rounds and then you can save all of your choices to a text 
                    document locally. When you start the timer you will get a countdown to get into your poition, 
                    and if a non custom exersise is labled you will get a diagram or gif to remind you what to do.
                    At any point you should be able to pause or go back to a periovous exersice.

                <h4>
                    Database structure
                </h4>
                <p>
                    There should be a database of exersices for the lables, that would store information on the
                    associated muscle groups as well as either a gif or an image for instruction. This would then connect to a
                    database of muscle groups that would have descriptions and allow for an index of them that would allow you
                    to find exersices for them. There also could be a database that connects to both of the prior ones that
                    would make a preselected routine for a group or combintation of group of muscles.
