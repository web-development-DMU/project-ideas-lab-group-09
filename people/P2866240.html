<h1>Moses Gbadamosi</h1>
<p>
    I am Moses, a Computer Science student with a passion for software development and problem-solving. I have experience in various programming languages and enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and creativity. I am particularly interested in web development and have built several projects that involve creating user-friendly interfaces and efficient backend systems. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my coding skills, and I enjoy collaborating with others to create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

<p>
    In this module, I am looking forward to learning more about web development and building a project that can be used by others. I am excited to work with my team and contribute my skills to create something useful and practical! I am hoping to get better at team collaboration whilst also improving my web development skills!
