    <h1> 
        Muhammad Mahadalla
    </h1>
    <p> I have very limited experience with web development, and most of what i know comes from brief exposure rather then hands on practise.
        I'm Famiiar with few basic concepts, but i havent yet built full projects or worked extensively with common tools, frameworks, or languages used in the field.
        I'm eager to learn and im motivated to build my skills through practical expericne and structured guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking forward to diving deeper into web development and turning what I learn into something practical and meaningful. I'm also eager to collaborate with others, exchange ideas, and contribute to a shared project. Along the way, I want to strengthen my teamwork abilities while continuing to grow my technical skills.
    </p>
