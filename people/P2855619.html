    <h3>Application ideas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A web application that reminds you to drink water in intervals to hit your daily goal </li>
        <li>A daily fitness challenge web application
            that gives users random fitness exercises to complete</li>
        <li>A meal planner based on the users macros. Gives the user recommendations
            on meals depending on their calories/protein/carbs and more they added.
