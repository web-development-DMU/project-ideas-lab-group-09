            I have little to no experience with web development, as before this course I had little 
            experince with programming. I'm a mature student and this is my second attempt at university,
            as originally I was studying Physics and Philosophy. After taking a gap year, I came to DMU to 
            studying Software Engineering as I've always enjoyed the personal projects where I got to programming
            and it seemed a logical while enjoyable choice for me.

            In the past I have not used much of CSS or HTML, all that comes to mind is using HTML tags when
            searching through API dictionaries. I also don't have any experience with JavaScript and I'm exited
            to learn a new language!
