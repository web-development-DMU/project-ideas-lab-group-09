        <p>
            I have little to no experience with web development and I am excited to learn more
            on this module! I have used CSS in passing many years ago and I haven't used
            JavaScript before and will be excited to learn new skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past all I have done is used HTML tags to find revelevant
            informartion when using APIs. However that was a few years ago now 
            and I'm looking forward to refreshing my knoweledge and expanding it.
