        <h1>Milan Paudel</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Milan Paudel, a Software Engineering student,
            and I have been into web development since I was 17 years old.
            One project I made was a product inventory manager.
        </p>

        <h1>Ideas for Projects</h1>
        <p>
            One project I was thinking of was an appointment system,
            as this system can be applied to various applications, such as a doctor appointment system.
            A form will be used to retrieve the information of the user booking the appointment;
            this includes their name, date of birth, email or phone number, and preferred time.
            The user should also be able to cancel their appointment or make any changes within a specific timeframe (e.g. 3 days)
        </p>
