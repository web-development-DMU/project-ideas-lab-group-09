 <h1> My name is James Monkhouse  </h1>

 <p> I have a small amount of experience in web development, i have used html before to create a web page and have expermimented with the body and styling to get different types of displays. I have implemented images and links on my web page and used different colours to make my pages more appealing to the eye. display and allignment of the page is probabaly a weak point in my abilities but believe i can overcome this with a few weeks of experience and teaching.!</p>

 <h1>My Webpage ideas:</h1>   
<ul> 
 
     <li> A sidebar that lists all pages making user interface simple </li>
     <li> clear titles and subheadings to make management easy </li> 
     <li>admin system authentication is a password - keep it simple</li>
     <li>search bar working alphabetically</li>
     <li>Home page containing image of university and whats accessible on the website</li>
 </ul>
