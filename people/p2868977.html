    <h1>Femi Yeku</h1>
    <p>
My name is Femi, I’m a second-year Software Engineering student with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and object-oriented design. Through academic projects and personal initiatives, I’ve developed hands-on experience building web and desktop applications using languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code and continuously improving my technical and collaboration skills.

I’m particularly interested in software development, backend systems, and emerging technologies. I’ve worked in team-based projects using version control tools like Git, where I contributed to planning, development, testing, and documentation. I’m eager to apply my growing technical knowledge in a professional environment, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue learning from experienced developers.    </p>
    <p>
        As a second-year Software Engineering student, I’m especially excited to be learning a new module in web development. Exploring both front-end and back-end technologies has deepened my interest in building responsive, user-focused applications that solve real problems. I’m motivated by the fast-paced nature of web technologies and enjoy experimenting with new frameworks, tools, and best practices to strengthen my skills.

I’m also enthusiastic about working in a team environment. Collaborating with others allows me to share ideas, learn different approaches to problem-solving, and improve my communication and adaptability. Through group projects, I’ve developed experience in task coordination, version control, and peer feedback, and I value the sense of shared achievement that comes from building something together. I’m eager to continue growing both technically and professionally through teamwork and hands-on web development experience.
