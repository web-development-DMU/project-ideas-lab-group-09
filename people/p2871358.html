    <p>
    I'm pretty new to web development, but I'm enjoying getting the hang of it.
    I've seen bits of HTML and CSS here and there, mostly when messing around with websites or looking things up, but I haven't really built anything proper until now.
    I'm just taking it step by step and figuring things out as I go.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm really looking forward to learning more about web development in this module and creating a project that people can actually use.
    I'm excited to work with my team and put my skills to good use while we build something practical.
    I'm also hoping to improve how I collaborate with others.
